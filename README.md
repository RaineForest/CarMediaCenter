# Car Media Center
A speech-based media center for my future car.
The future plan is a completely hands-free control system for a car.

This includes:
- Radio
- Temperature controls
- GPS
- Cellular functions
- (far future) Autonomous driving

Driven by:
- [festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) text-to-speech
- [julius](http://julius.osdn.jp/en_index.php) speech-to-text
